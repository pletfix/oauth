#### User Role

The "memberof" attribute is used to determine the user role. You may edit the member mapping in the configuration file 
`config/ldap`.

#### User Model

If you have defined a user model in the configuration, the user attributes are stored in the database.
By default, the user model from the [Pletfix Application Skeleton](https://github.com/pletfix/app) is used and no 
further migration is required.

### LDAP Service

#### Accessing the LDAP service

You can get an instance of the LDAP Service from the Dependency Injector:

    /** @var Pletfix\Ldap\Services\Contracts\Ldap $ldap */
    $ldap = DI::getInstance()->get('ldap');
    
You can also use the `ldap()` function to get the LDAP service, it is more comfortable:
       
    $ldap = ldap();

#### Available Methods

#### `search`

Search LDAP tree and get all result entries.

    $users = $ldap->search('userprincipalname=Fr*');

#### `getUsers`

Get the user entries.

    $users = $ldap->getUsers();
    
You may also set a filter for the `userprincipalname` attribute:
    
    $users = $ldap->getUsers('Fr*');

#### `getUser`

Get the user attributes by given username (userPrincipalName or samAccountName).

    $user = $ldap->getUser('FrankR');
    
You may define the attributes of the user in the configuration file `config/ldap`.            

#### `authenticate`

Authenticate the user through the Active Directory.

    $isAuthenticated = $ldap->authenticate($username, $password);

#### `getErrorCode`

Return the LDAP error code of the last LDAP command.

    $errorCode = $ldap->getErrorCode();

#### `getErrorMessage`

Return the LDAP error message of the last LDAP command.

    $errorMessage = $ldap->getErrorMessage();
